- // should I write "accessed on" to all links (including footnotes)? NOPE
- // should I put the concluding sentences of each chapter under a Conclusions section? YES
- // should I evaluate all students and teachers on the test set and report this? YES
- // is it alright to cite myself (the rasa blog posts)? YES
- // should I include the analysed sentences (pred. analysis) in the appendix?
- // mention use of CoLA annotations in prediction analysis? they weren't useful at all. NO
- // should I mention concrete scripts which I wrote? NO
- // should I report prediction speed (on CPU)? YES, in 5.3
- // should I include the publisher in all article references? and age numbers in proceedings? VENUE OF PUBLICATION, ideally page numbers
- // are huge graphs understandable? YES
- // should I show probing baseline results of Conneau et al? YES also Ganesh_2019 has results for BERT_Base


// explain moving avg and crosses in tuning hparams, maybe show raw score and compare with avg

ch5: explain methodoogy (chronology) but then jump to outcomes (all best hparams). put details of intermediate results into appendix. summary will likely become much shorter. add teacher params in table 5.3 and also eval-set scores.

ch6: make descriptions shorter
pred-anal: mention in intro also the main findings
probing: remove chronology, only present findings


// merge aims and contributions

// make discussion more concise and precise

// get rid of "without doubt", etc

// short intro at the beginning of the discussion chapter

// change bars into dots

// tables 6.1 and 6.2 on the same page

// "speed" change to "time" or sth
// "size" add units (M)

// include all own CoLA diag. sentences in the appendix
