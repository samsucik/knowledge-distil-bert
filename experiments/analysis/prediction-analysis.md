# Prediction analysis
## Questions/tasks to answer
### Individual models
- describe when the models fail and succeed (i.e. describe the hits/misses)
- describe the confidence of predictions: how confident is the model on average? and just on the mistakes?
- describe the confident/unconfident hits/misses of each individual student

### Comparing models (think about differences within one student)
- is one student generally more confident than the other?
- describe cases where one student is very confident and the other one is very unconfident
- describe cases where one student is right and the other is wrong
- what's the overlap of the 2 students' mistakes and which ones are unique to one student?

### Exploring knowledge distillation
- describe cases where teacher is confident but both students are unconfident
- describe cases where teacher is right but both students are wrong

### Overall
- what are the strengths/weaknesses of each student?

## Samples to look at
Find samples that:
- are predicted differently by different students (in terms of label)
- are predicted very confidently by some students but unconfidently by others

## CoLA
### Teacher
#### Confident mistakes
*All* are unacc predicted as acc.
Many are based on verbal properties, i.e. a specific verb taking specific args. Hence, many of the sentences would've been OK if the verb was replaced by a different one. So, this is also a semantic issue. (S)

Word order:
- mary beautifully plays the violin. (adverb position) (S)

Long-range dep.
- which house does your friend live? (missing prep.) (S)
- jack is the person with whom jenny fell in love with. (repeated prep.)
- she was bathing, but i couldn't make out who. (intransitive with illegal argument) (V)
- sally asked if somebody was going to fail math class, but i can't remember who. (quantifier)
- that the cops spoke to the janitor about it yesterday is terrible, that robbery. (clause reordering illegal here, long-range thing)

Missing prep.
- Mary intended John to go abroad (S)

Inserted expletive
- john believes it sincerely that bill is here.

- that is the reason why he resigned.

#### Unconfident hits
Tricky examples

### LSTM
#### Confident mistakes
*All* are unacc predicted as acc. Interesting are binding cases and cases with illegal/missing prepositions. Doesn't really struggle with long-range deps.

Binding
- protect you!
- wash you!
- kick you!

Semantic violation
- chocolate eggs were hidden from each other by the children. (would be fine with different verb, not "hidden", or with different clause order)
- mary wonders that bill will come. (would be fine with "thinks")
- the jeweller scribbled the contract with his name. ("decorated the ring with his name" would be ok)
- no one can forgive that comment to you. (word order; would be ok with "give")

Relational adjectives
- the children are fond that they have ice cream. (required preposition "of" not used, would be ok with "happy" instead of "fond")

Miscellanous
- bill must quickly eat the peaches, and harry must slowly. (anaphor, long-range issue ("too" would be ok instad of "slowly"))
- sophie will theater. (kinda semantic -- the specific verb doesn't permit NP object)

- john heard that they criticized themselves. (weird sentence, maybe "him" was the desired word?) (unacc)

#### Confident hits
**All accs**. Some simple sentences (susan told her a story.) and some a bit less typical (i.e. not simple SVO):
- you will believe bob.
- john told mary that it was important to fred to leave early.
- john told mary that it would be important to leave early.
- those pictures of us offended us.

Miscellaneous
- they chased the man with the car. (should be easy) (acc)

#### Confident hits

### Cases where one student is very confident and the other one is very unconfident
In most of these cases, the teacher is also quite unconfident or even wrong. It's very difficult to spot patterns in the sentences (describe what they've got in common).

When LSTM is unconfident and BERT is confident, it's mostly:
- lstm careful (correct), BERT confident (correct):      5x
- lstm careful (incorrect), BERT confident (incorrect):  3x
- rest (2x): lstm careful (incorrect), BERT confident (correct), OR lstm careful (correct), BERT confident (incorrect)

When BERT is unconfident and LSTM is confident, it's mostly:
- BERT careful (incorrect), LSTM confident (incorrect): 3x
- BERT careful (correct), LSTM confident (correct):     3x
- BERT careful (incorrect), LSTM confident (correct):   3x
- BERT careful (correct), LSTM confident (incorrect):   1x

### Cases where one student is right and the other is wrong (teacher being right)
Hard to interpret and draw conclusions. Generally, many long sentences appear here. Also, in most cases the teacher is below-average confident and one or both students are very unconfident as well (sometimes the correct one, sometimes the incorrect one, and in ~50% cases both).

### Overlap of the 2 students' hits/misses
Surprisingly many mistakes are model-specific! Rougly 1/3 of each model's mistakes are made only by that model and the other model gets those right.

### Cases where teacher is confident but both students are unconfident
Most of these are really tricky sentences, mostly acceptable, and mostly predicted correctly but unconfidently by the teacher, with mixed correctness of students. Basically, hard cases that the teacher barely handles and the students are either just very unconfident or even incorrect.

Tricky examples:
- most columnists claim that a senior white house official has been briefing them, but none will reveal which one.  
- clearly, john probably will immediately learn french perfectly.
- bill's story about sue and max's about kathy both amazed me.

The two unacceptable examples (which the teacher got wrong):
- the cat were bitten by the dog. (morphology) (unacc)
- jones, that we were talking to last night, always watches football games alone. (long-range issue) (unacc)

### Cases where teacher is right but both students are wrong
These are long sentences:
- neither von karajan's recording of beethoven's 6th on columbia nor klemperer's has the right tempo. (acc)
- if the ants were called elephants and elephants ants, i'd be able to squash an elephant. (acc)
- bill's wine from france and ted's from california cannot be compared. (acc)

as well as sentences that are problematic only semantically:
- my heart is pounding me. (unacc)
- leslie told us about us. (unacc)
- the tube was escaped by gas. (unacc)

but also other short ungrammatical cases:
- the children are fond with the ice cream. (requires knowledge of the specific verb and its prepositions) (unacc)
- the table was wiped by john clean. (long-range deps) (unacc)

In most cases, the teacher is right but unconfident. These are difficult sentences and the students, sometimes very confidently, make mistakes on them -- possibly due to their length and complexity, and due to missing semantic knowledge needed to detect ungrammaticality.

### Mistake type analysis (CoLA only)
On simple sentences, students roughly match the teacher, it's the harder cases where students start making mistakes.

Differences were considered only where there's ~100 or more examples in the category.

#### BERT better:
In general, confidence of students and teacher on most of these is low.
- adjunct (major), not consistently across minor categories
- binding (major), consistently across minor categories (SCRAP)
- VP adjunct    (maj: adjunct): mostly acceptable sentences, mostly correctly predicted by teacher. in many cases, quite long sentences with long-range deps. various examples, from `i gave pete the book to impress.` to `joan ate dinner with someone but i don't know who with.` to `the bed was slept in.`.
- Misc adjunct  (maj: adjunct): mostly acceptable sentences, mostly correctly predicted by teacher. in many cases, quite long sentences with long-range deps. various examples, from `he left the train with somebody else's wallet in his pocket.` to `mary asked me if, in st. louis, john could rent a house cheap.` to `i presented it to bill to read.`
- Oblique   (SCRAP)    (maj: arg types): mixed examples, often short, mostly correctly predicted by teacher. examples range from semantically tricky `lou hoped the umbrella in the closet.`, `sam offered the ball out of the basket.`, `mary revealed himself to john.` to relatively easy ones `martha carved the baby a toy out of wood.`, `john left us orders to follow pete.`
- PP Arg-VP  (SCRAP)   (maj: arg types): mostly acceptable sentences, mostly long, mostly correctly predicted by teacher. includes sentences that are long and/or with atypical ordering: `she said she had spoken to everybody, but he wasn't sure who.`, `he attributed to a short circuit which was caused by an overloaded transducer the fire which destroyed most of my factory.`, `the ta's have been arguing about whether some student or other should pass, but i can't now remember which one.`, `it was to john that i gave the book.`.
- high arity  (SCRAP)  (maj: arg altern): mostly acceptable sentences, mostly medium/short, sometimes incorrectly predicted even by teacher. tricky sentences like `we gave presents to ourselves.`, `john regretted it that bill had a good time.`, `i presented it to bill to read.`, `clinton is anxious to find out which budget dilemmas panetta would be willing to tackle in a certain way, but he won't say in which.`
- Add Arg   (SCRAP)    (maj: arg altern): mixed examples, often medium/short, mostly correctly predicted by teacher. various examples: `john believes it sincerely that bill is here.`, `there is a seat available.`, `there presented itself a wonderful opportunity yesterday.`, `i squeaked the door.`

#### LSTM better:
In general, confidence of students and teacher on most of these is low.
- predicate (major), mostly due to copula, really
- determiner (major), mostly due to quantifier, really (SCRAP)
- Comp Clause (major) (NEW)
- copula        (maj: pred): unacceptable sentences which the teacher predicts mostly correctly. issues often related to word/clause order: `i wonder what to be a clown on the cover of.`, `because she's so pleasant, as for mary i really like her.`, `that john is reluctant seems.`, ``
