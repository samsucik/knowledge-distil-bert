# Prediction analysis
## Questions/tasks to answer
### Individual models
- describe when the models fail and succeed (i.e. describe the hits/misses)
- describe the confidence of predictions: how confident is the model on average? and just on the mistakes?
- describe the confident/unconfident hits/misses of each individual student

### Comparing models (think about differences within one student)
- is one student generally more confident than the other?
- describe cases where one student is very confident and the other one is very unconfident
- describe cases where one student is right and the other is wrong
- what's the overlap of the 2 students' mistakes and which ones are unique to one student?

### Exploring knowledge distillation
- describe cases where teacher is confident but both students are unconfident
- describe cases where teacher is right but both students are wrong

### Overall
- what are the strengths/weaknesses of each student?

## Samples to look at
Find samples that:
- are predicted differently by different students (in terms of label)
